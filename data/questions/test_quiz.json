      "Stack",
      "Array",

    ],
    "correct_option_id": 1,
    "explanation": "Stack follows the LIFO principle: the last element added is the first one to be removed."

    "question": "Which sorting algorithm has O(n log n) worst-case time complexity?",
    "options": [
      "Bubble Sort",
      "Quick Sort",
      "Merge Sort",
      "Selection Sort"
